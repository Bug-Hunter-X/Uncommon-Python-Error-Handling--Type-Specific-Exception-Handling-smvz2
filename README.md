# Uncommon Python Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a Python function that handles uncommon error scenarios during division. It highlights how to gracefully manage different exception types based on the nature of the input values.

The `bug.py` file contains the function with error handling.  `bugSolution.py` may contain a more robust and improved version of this function. 

The goal of this example is to show best practices when anticipating potential errors and preventing unexpected crashes.
